# Cline Extension Architecture

This directory contains architectural documentation for the Cline VSCode extension.

## Extension Architecture Diagram

The [extension-architecture.mmd](./extension-architecture.mmd) file contains a Mermaid diagram showing the high-level architecture of the Cline extension. The diagram illustrates:

1. **Core Extension**
   - Extension entry point and main classes
   - State management through VSCode's global state and secrets storage
   - Core business logic in the Cline class

2. **Webview UI**
   - React-based user interface
   - State management through ExtensionStateContext
   - Component hierarchy

3. **Storage**
   - Task-specific storage for history and state
   - Git-based checkpoint system for file changes

4. **Data Flow**
   - Core extension data flow between components
   - Webview UI data flow
   - Bidirectional communication between core and webview

## Viewing the Diagram

To view the diagram:
1. Install a Mermaid diagram viewer extension in VSCode
2. Open extension-architecture.mmd
3. Use the extension's preview feature to render the diagram

You can also view the diagram on GitHub, which has built-in Mermaid rendering support.

## Color Scheme

The diagram uses a high-contrast color scheme for better visibility:
- Pink (#ff0066): Global state and secrets storage components
- Blue (#0066ff): Extension state context
- Green (#00cc66): Cline provider
- All components use white text for maximum readability

## Purpose and Structure of the Architecture Documentation

The architecture documentation aims to provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the Cline extension's architecture. It is structured to help developers understand the main components and modules of the project architecture.

### Main Components and Modules

- **Core Extension:** The core logic and state management of the extension.
- **Webview UI:** The user interface components and their interactions.
- **Storage:** The mechanisms for storing task-specific data and checkpoints.
- **Data Flow:** The flow of data between different components and modules.

### Understanding and Navigating the Architecture Diagrams

To understand and navigate the architecture diagrams effectively:
1. Familiarize yourself with the main components and their roles.
2. Follow the data flow paths to see how information moves between components.
3. Use the color scheme to identify different types of components and their interactions.

### Contributing to the Architecture Documentation

We welcome contributions to the architecture documentation. If you have suggestions or find areas that could be enhanced, please let us know. You can submit changes and improvements through pull requests on the Cline GitHub repository. Please follow the guidelines for submitting changes and improvements to ensure consistency and quality.
